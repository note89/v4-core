{"title":"Flash Accounting","id":"xbw2xZC87xYjZUua4R6FVsvSS4WTMG6ZwpvylU+qOJY=","steps":[{"type":"textOnly","description":"Welcome to this code tour on **Flash Accounting** in `Uniswap V4`! \n\n**Flash accounting** is a cornerstone innovation in `Uniswap V4`'s architecture, designed to significantly enhance efficiency and reduce gas costs. At its core, **flash accounting** allows multiple actions to be chained together in a single transaction, tracking only the net token balances at the end.\n\nKey aspects of **flash accounting** in `Uniswap V4`:\n1. **Singleton contract**: All pools are held within one smart contract.\n2. **Net balance tracking**: Only final token balances are settled.\n3. **Transient storage**: Efficient state management during transactions.\n4. **Lock mechanism**: Ensures all debts are settled before transaction completion.\n\nThis system replaces the need for intermediate token transfers between pools, as seen in previous versions. As we dive into the implementation details, pay close attention to how these components interact to create a more gas-efficient and flexible trading environment.","title":"","id":"3065"},{"type":"revealFiles","files":["src/libraries/Lock.sol"],"description":"The `Lock` library is a crucial component of Uniswap V4's flash accounting system.

The `unlock()` function sets the lock state to true, allowing operations to proceed.\n\nThis function uses transient storage (`tstore`) to efficiently set the `IS_UNLOCKED_SLOT` to `true`.

It orchestrates the process by:\n\n1. Checking if the contract is already unlocked (using `Lock.isUnlocked()`).\n2. Unlocking the contract (`Lock.unlock()`).\n3. Executing the user's callback function (`IUnlockCallback(msg.sender).unlockCallback(data)`).\n4. Verifying all balances are settled (`NonzeroDeltaCount.read()`).\n5. Re-locking the contract (`Lock.lock()`).\n\nThis function integrates the `Lock` and `NonzeroDeltaCount` libraries we saw earlier. It allows users to perform multiple operations (swaps, liquidity changes) in a single transaction, tracking net balances using `CurrencyDelta`. The callback pattern enables flexible, user-defined sequences of actions while ensuring all debts are settled before the transaction ends.\n\nAs an auditor, pay close attention to the state changes and error handling in this critical function.","file":"src/PoolManager.sol","highlight":[{"start":102,"end":112}],"title":"","id":"3069"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The `BalanceDelta` type is a crucial component in Uniswap V4's flash accounting system.
